# Default Apps

An application to register custom XDG protocols on Linux. This is useful for those obscure applications (or Wine applications set up without another wrapper) that didn't set up the protocol themselves.

Still in development. Not nearly done yet.

Backend: Vala
Front-end: GTK 4 with Libadwaita
